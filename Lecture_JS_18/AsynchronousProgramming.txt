Synchronous Code :
-> code execute line by line


Asynchronous Programming :

JS : Single Threaded Language -> it has only one call stack

Disadvantage of Single threaded :
1. Jab tak delay poora nhi ho jata tab tak aage nhi jaa sakta.
jis se poora website freeze ho jayega
This is a big issue for the js.


Solution for Single Thread :
Asynchronous Programming :
1. Js ka thread free karna hai taaki browser freeze na ho, lekin
    5 sec ka delay bhi jaroori hai, us ignore nhi kar sakte

-> It's highly required jaha delay needed hai
        -> Movie download
        -> song play/ Movie play
1. Set TimeOut
2. Set Interval
from point 1 and point 2, we can write Asynchronous code.

Browswer C++ mai likhi gayi hai
toh mutli threading possible hai
