                        Gill's research has focused on arms control, non-proliferation, peacekeeping and military-technical development related to China and the Asia-Pacific region. His work has also encompassed other contemporary security-related issues including multilateral security organizations, the impact of domestic politics and development on the foreign policies of states, and the nexus of public health and security. Currently, his work focuses on the role of the Chinese Communist Party in the deliberation and implementation of Chinese foreign and security policy, and China's engagement with the Global South.
                        He is currently executive director of the Center for China Analysis with the Asia Society Policy Institute[8] and a Senior Associate Fellow with the Royal United Services Institute. Before his current role, he was Professor and chair in the Department of Security Studies and Criminology at Macquarie University.
